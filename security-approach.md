# Security Approach for Realtime Voting System

## Comparison: ECS + Aurora vs Auth0

### Option 1: ECS (EC2 Launch Type) + Aurora + Custom Auth

**Architecture:**
```
Users → WAF → ALB → ECS Cluster (EC2) → Aurora PostgreSQL
                         ↓
                 Custom Auth Service + JWT
```

**Pros:**
- Full control over auth logic
- No vendor lock-in for identity
- Custom bot detection rules
- Lower long-term costs at scale
- Meets "no serverless" restriction

**Cons:**
- Build everything from scratch
- Security responsibility on you
- More development time
- Need expertise in auth patterns
- Operational overhead

**Cost (300M users):**
- Aurora: ~$2,000-5,000/month
- ECS EC2: ~$1,000-3,000/month
- **Total: ~$3,000-8,000/month**

### Option 2: Auth0 + ECS + Aurora (for voting data)

**Architecture:**
```
Users → Auth0 → ECS Cluster (EC2) → Aurora PostgreSQL
                     ↓
              Voting Service Only
```

**Pros:**
- Proven at Netflix scale (200M+ users)
- Built-in bot detection
- Enterprise security features
- Faster time to market
- 99.9% SLA

**Cons:**
- Vendor dependency
- Higher costs at scale
- Less customization
- External service dependency

**Cost (300M users):**
- Auth0 Enterprise: ~$15,000-30,000/month
- ECS + Aurora: ~$3,000-8,000/month
- **Total: ~$18,000-38,000/month**

## Recommendation:

**Start with Auth0** for faster launch, then **migrate to custom ECS solution** once you validate the business model and have more resources.

## Technology Explanations

### AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
A cloud-based firewall service that protects web applications from common web exploits, bots, and DDoS attacks. Provides rate limiting, IP filtering, and custom security rules.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
AWS load balancing service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers). Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) and supports advanced routing.

### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
AWS container orchestration service that manages Docker containers. EC2 launch type runs containers on EC2 instances you manage, while Fargate is serverless.

### Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL
AWS managed relational database service compatible with PostgreSQL. Provides high performance, availability, and automatic scaling with up to 15 read replicas.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Industry standard for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON objects. Used for stateless authentication and session management.

### Auth0
Third-party identity and access management platform. Provides authentication, authorization, and security features including bot detection and anomaly detection at enterprise scale.

### AWS Secrets Manager
AWS service for securely storing, managing, and retrieving secrets like API keys, passwords, and certificates. Provides automatic rotation and fine-grained access control.
