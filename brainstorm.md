# Realtime voting system requirements
- Never loose data
- Be secure and prevent bots and bad actors
- Handle 300M users
- Handle peak of 250k RPS
- Must ensure users vote only once

## Restrictions (do not use)
- Serveless
- MongoDB
- On-Premise, Google Cloud, Azure
- OpenShift
- Mainframes
- Monolith Solutions

# Realtime Voting System Security Brainstorm

## 1. What "secure and prevent bots and bad actors" means:

**Security threats in voting systems:**
- **Bot attacks**: Automated scripts creating fake votes at scale
- **Sybil attacks**: Single user creating multiple fake identities
- **Vote manipulation**: Changing/deleting legitimate votes
- **DDoS attacks**: Overwhelming system to prevent legitimate voting
- **Data tampering**: Modifying vote counts or voter records
- **Replay attacks**: Reusing valid voting requests multiple times

## 2. How to handle this:

**Core security principles:**
- **Authentication**: Verify voter identity
- **Authorization**: Ensure one vote per eligible voter
- **Integrity**: Protect vote data from tampering
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent automated attacks
- **Audit trails**: Track all voting activities
- **Encryption**: Secure data in transit and at rest

## 3. Three implementation options:

### 3.1 Architecture-based solutions:

**Option A: Multi-layer verification architecture**
```
Client → Rate Limiter → CAPTCHA → Auth Service → Vote Validator → Blockchain/DB
```
- Rate limiting (Redis/AWS WAF)
- CAPTCHA verification
- Multi-factor authentication
- Vote deduplication logic
- Immutable audit trail

**Option B: Zero-trust microservices**
```
Identity Service ← → Vote Service ← → Audit Service
       ↓                ↓              ↓
   User DB         Vote Storage    Audit Logs
```
- Each service validates independently
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Service mesh security (Istio)
- Real-time fraud detection

**Option C: Event-driven with ML detection**
```
Vote Events → Stream Processor → ML Model → Alert/Block
                    ↓
              Vote Aggregator
```
- Kafka/Kinesis for event streaming
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Behavioral analysis patterns
- Automatic threat response

### 3.2 Tool-based solutions:

**AWS Stack:**
- **AWS WAF**: DDoS protection, rate limiting
- **Amazon Cognito**: User authentication/authorization
- **AWS Shield**: Advanced DDoS protection
- **Amazon Fraud Detector**: ML-based fraud detection
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Audit logging

**Third-party tools:**
- **Auth0**: Identity management with bot detection
- **Cloudflare**: Bot management and rate limiting
- **reCAPTCHA v3**: Invisible bot detection
- **DataDome**: Real-time bot protection
- **Sift**: Fraud prevention platform

**Blockchain options:**
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Permissioned voting network
- **Ethereum**: Smart contract-based voting
- **Polygon**: Lower-cost blockchain voting

## Notes

Each approach offers different trade-offs between security, cost, complexity, and scalability. The choice depends on your specific requirements for voter volume, budget, and security level needed.
